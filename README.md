## EVN Primary Beam Correction

These are the scripts used for EVN primary beam correction in Radcliffe+2017 in. prep. They are tailored to just this observation. I will change them in a future date.

Note that this requires astropy 1.3.3... there is a bug in two that prevent the modelling creating the beam. Im investigating a workaround..
